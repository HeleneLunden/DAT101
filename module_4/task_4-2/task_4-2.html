      <li>1. What is an array? A short and concise answer is expected here!</li>
      <p>An array is a data structure that stores multiple values in a single variable. 
        Each value, or element, is indexed, starting from 0. Arrays are useful for 
        organizing data and enabling easy access, iteration, and manipulation.</p>


      <li>2. What does it mean to "hardcode" when we talk about programming? (In English, 
        it's called "hard coding", "hard-coding", or "hardcoding").</li>
      <p>Hardcoding means explicitly writing values directly into the code rather 
        than dynamically generating or retrieving them at runtime. For example, writing 
        let numbers = [1, 2, 3]; is hardcoding, while generating the array dynamically 
        based on user input or calculations is not. Hardcoding is simple but lacks flexibility.</p>


      <li>3. Explain in plain text what happens in task 3, and how we can traverse (iterate) the array when we
        (humans) don't "know" how long the array is.</li>
      <p>In Task 3, a string is converted into an array using the .split() method. 
        Each word in the string becomes an element in the array. To traverse the array, 
        a loop (e.g., for or forEach) is used. Since the array’s length is unknown, 
        we use the .length property to ensure the loop iterates through all elements</p>


      <li>4. Why is it beneficial to store instances of a class in arrays, as in task 4?</li>
      <p>Storing class instances in arrays allows for organized and efficient management 
        of related objects. For example, in Task 4, storing multiple TBook instances in an 
        array makes it easy to perform operations on all books, such as iterating over them 
        to print their details or applying filters to find specific books.</p>


      <li>5. Try your best to explain the EWeekDays object from task 7. How do we use the "value" attribute, for
        example? In what way do "WeekDay", "Workdays", and "Weekends" differ from each other? If we
        wanted to create a new element "WorkoutDays", which would contain "Monday", "Wednesday", and
        "Thursday", how would it ideally look? (I will choose the best answer to this task and reward it with
        pizza in the cafeteria right after New Year. Remember to mark in your submission if you want to
        participate in the competition!)</li>
      <p>The EWeekDays object maps keys (e.g., WeekDay1) to values that represent days of the week. 
        Each entry contains attributes such as value (a bitmask) and name (the day’s name). 
        This structure allows for easy access to day-related data. For example, Workdays aggregates 
        values for Monday through Friday. To add a new element like WorkoutDays (Monday, Wednesday, Thursday), 
        you could define it as:
        WorkoutDays: { value: 0x01 + 0x04 + 0x08, name: "WorkoutDays" }

      </p> *//I want to participate in the competition!! With my group Ebbs, Stine and Benedicte. //*

      <li>6. In task 8, we will use a "callback" routine when sorting. Explain how such a "callback" routine works.</li>
      <p>In Task 8, the .sort() method uses a callback function to determine the sorting order. The callback compares two elements (a and b) and returns:

        A negative value if a should come before b
        A positive value if a should come after b
        Zero if they are equal
        For example, to sort in ascending order:
        numbers.sort((a, b) => a - b);
      </p>


      <li>7. What happens in the sorting routines you have created? Try to explain how the array can figure out
        if an element should come before or after another. The best way to answer this is to actually print
        both parameters each time the sorting routine runs.</li>
      <p>The sorting routines iterate through the array multiple times, comparing elements based on the 
        callback function. The callback function determines whether one element is "greater than" another 
        and thus needs to be swapped. JavaScript's sort algorithm typically uses an optimized version of 
        the QuickSort or MergeSort algorithm for efficiency.</p>


      <li>8. In task 10, we will create an array with rows and columns. Explain what the first element of the array
        contains.</li>
      <p>In Task 10, the first element of the array represents the first row of the 2D array. 
        Each row is an array containing strings that describe the cell's row and column positions. 
        For example, the first element might look like this:
        ["Row: 0, Col: 0", "Row: 0, Col: 1", ..., "Row: 0, Col: 8"]
      </p>
