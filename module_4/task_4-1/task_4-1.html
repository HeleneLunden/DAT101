      <li>1. Why is object-oriented development so important in programming?</li>
      <p>Object-oriented programming (OOP) is important because it provides a structured and modular 
        approach to development, where code is organized into objects that represent real-world 
        entities with associated properties and behaviors. This makes the code more readable, reusable, 
        and easier to maintain. In your code, the TAccount class represents an account with specific 
        properties like type, balance, currency, and methods such as deposit and withdrawal, making it 
        simple to reuse and expand functionality.</p>

      <li>2. In Task 1, we created a static object called "AccountType." 
        Explain what this object is used for and how this type of object can 
        help us in software development.</li>
      <p>The AccountType object stores constant values for account types (such as "Normal," "Saving," etc.). 
        This type of object is used to organize and centralize values that can be reused in multiple 
        places within the program. It contributes to consistency and makes the code easier to maintain. 
        If the account types need to be changed, updating them in the AccountType object will automatically 
        update all references in the code.</p>

      <li>Discuss why we use encapsulation in classes. Why do we want to "hide" code within our class? 
        Explain how we can create "private" and "public" members in a constructor function.</li>
      <p>Encapsulation is used to protect and organize data and functions within a class. By "hiding" 
        parts of the code with private members, we can control access to internal data and prevent unintended 
        changes from outside the class. This makes the program more robust and ensures the class is 
        used correctly. In JavaScript, we can use the # symbol before a variable name (e.g., #balance) 
        to designate it as private, while public members are accessible without the #. In your code, private 
        members like #balance and #currencyType are used to maintain control over the balance and currency</p>

      <li>Explain what happens when we use the "new" command in JavaScript.</li>
      <p>When we use the new command in JavaScript, a new instance of a class is created. 
        This process involves setting up a new object, binding this to it within the constructor, 
        and initializing the object's properties and methods as defined in the class. Using new 
        with a class like TAccount in your code creates a new account instance with its own properties, 
        such as type, balance, and currency. This instance can then interact with other parts of the program 
        independently of other instances.</p>
