      <li>Where should you use constants, and where should you use variables? Can they all be constants?</li>
      <p>
				You use constants when the value is going to be the same throughout the entire program. 
        This prevents you from accidentally changing the constant. It provides stability and readability.
        You use variables when the value can change later in the program. An example is user inputs.
        
        Not all variables can be constants. If a value needs to change, for example based on logic or 
        user interaction, it has to be a variable.

      <li>How do parentheses affect the arithmetic outcome of an expression?</li>
      <p>
				Parentheses define the order of operations in the expression. 
        This means that we use parentheses when we need to "solve" the expression in a specific order.
        You "solve" the part inside of the parentheses first, and then the rest.
			</p>
      <li>How do we limit floating-point numbers to a given number of decimals?</li>
      <p>
				To limit floating-point numbers to a given number of decimals, we can use this element in our program: toFixed().
        The number of decimals you want, you enter into the parentheses.
        
        The answer will appear as a text. We know that because the number will have "" in front and after it. We use the parse.float() to convert it back to a numeric answer.
        
			</p>
      <li>How can we compare two floating-point values to see if they are equal (is 12.199999 the same as 12.2)?</li>
      <p>
				We can check if the difference between them is smaller than a given "tolerance". This is necessary due to the floating point numbers not being represented precisely enough,
        which can lead to rounding problems.
        The tolerance is 0,01.
        We use "if" to find the answer:
       let a = 12.2;
       let b = 12.199999;
       if ((a-b) < 0.01)  {
          console.log("True")
        }  
        The program will give you the answer "True". The numbers are considered equal within the tolerance of 0.01.

			</p>
      <li>What do comparison operators return, and how can we check if they are FALSE or TRUE?</li>
      <p>
				Comparison numbers return a boolean value. This value is either "true" or "false".
        You can check if the result is true or false using "if" and "else".
			</p>
      <li>How does the Math.random() function work, and what can it be used for?</li>
      <p>
				Math.random() gives us a random number x, where 0 <= x < 1,0. 
        This function can generate random numbers within a specific range or creating random elements for a game or simulations.
			</p>
      <li>What is modulus (%), and when do we need this operator in mathematical operations?</li>
      <p>
				The modulus operator returns the remainder of the division of two numbers. In simpler terms, it gives you
        the "leftover" when you divide one number by another. We need this operator in mathematical operations when
        we want to figure out if a number is even or odd.
