      <li>1. In part 1, is it possible to solve the problem using a single "for" loop?</li>
      <p>Yes, it is possible to solve the problem using a single "for" loop if we manipulate the loop's 
        condition or logic to print two sequences within the same loop. For example, we could use a single 
        loop that runs from 1 to 10 and prints both counting up and down based on the current iteration. 
        However, this would require some conditional logic to differentiate between the sequences.</p>
      
        <li>2. In part 2, can we create what is known as an "infinite" loop within the condition of the "while" loop?
          Describe what would or would not be necessary to achieve this. Provide a thorough explanation of
          your answer.</li>
      <p>Yes, an "infinite" loop can be created in a "while" loop if the condition never becomes false. 
        For instance, using while (true) will create an infinite loop that will continue until an external 
        factor breaks it, such as a break statement or a user action. To prevent an infinite loop from running 
        endlessly and potentially crashing the program, we need a condition inside the loop that will eventually 
        change or terminate the loop when necessary.</p>

      <li>3. Discuss briefly how quickly or slowly a computer might be able to compute this, considering the
        number of guesses and the time it takes. How does the program behave while it is guessing? Can
        the program perform other tasks concurrently?</li>
      <p>The speed of computation depends on the number of iterations required for the guessing process. 
        A simple program like this, running on modern hardware, should perform very quickly even if it involves 
        thousands of guesses. However, during execution, especially in a synchronous environment, the program 
        may appear to freeze as it guesses repeatedly in a loop. Unless the program is running in an asynchronous 
        manner or within a separate thread, it would not be able to perform other tasks concurrently while it is 
        executing the guessing loop.</p>

      <li>4. Explain the relationship between rows and columns in nested "for" loops. Can we, for instance,
        change the order, considering rows to be innermost or columns to be innermost, or does this not
        matter?</li>
      <p>In nested "for" loops, the relationship between rows and columns determines how data is processed 
        or displayed. Typically, the outer loop represents rows, and the inner loop represents columns, which 
        means the program completes a full pass through all columns for each row iteration. However, the order 
        can be changed to have columns as the outer loop and rows as the inner loop, depending on the desired 
        output or logic. While this does not affect the fundamental operation, it changes the way data is accessed 
        or displayed in a structured format.</p>
