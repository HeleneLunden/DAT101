      <li>What is the difference between invoking and creating a function?</li>
      <p>Creating a function is defining it with the function keyword followed by a name
        and a block of code inside {}that specifies what the function does. For example:
        function printTodaysDate() {...}. invoking a function is calling it to execute, usually
        by writing the function name followed by (), like printTodaysDate();
      </p>
      <li>Explain the syntax regarding semicolons and code blocks.</li>
      <p>In Javascript, semicolons are used to terminate statements, although they are optional in many cases. 
        Code blocks, like those in functions, are enclosed in curly braces {}, allowing multiple statements to
        be grouped together.
      </p>
      <li>What happens when we try to store values from a function when it doesn't return any?</li>
      <p>If you try to store the result of a function that does'nt return anything, the stored value will
        be undefined. For example, let result = printTodaysDate(); would make result undefined since
        printTodaysDate does not return anything.
      </p>
      <li>How do we separate parameters from each other when creating a function?</li>
      <p>Parameters are separated by commas inside the parentheses of the function definition.
        For instance, in function convertTemperature(temp, scale) {...}, temp and scale are separated by a comma.
      
      </p>
      <li>Explain how parameter names are related during the invocation and creation of a function.</li>
      <p>When a function is created, parameter names act as placeholders. When you invoke the function, 
        you pass actual values (arguments) that replace these  placeholders. For instance, in 
        convertTemperature (25, "C"), 25 replaces temp, and "C" replaces scale.
      </p>
      <li>Explain why a parameter is undefined when a function call is missing a parameter.</li>
      <p>If a function is called with fewer arguments than defines parameters,
        the missing parameters will be undefined. For example, convertTemperature(25) 
        would make scale undefined, as there's no second argument to assign to scale.
      </p>
      <li>Explain what happens when we use recursive functions.</li>
      <p>A recursive function calls itself until it reaches a base condition to stop. 
        For example, in your factorial function, it keeps calling itself with n - 1 until 
        n is 1, which prevents infinite recursion. Recursive functions are useful for 
        repetitive tasks but can lead to stack overflow if the base case is not correctly defined.</p>
